# MENTANA-backend

This backend application is built with Node.js, Express, Sequelize (an object-relational mapper), and PostgreSQL for database interactions.

## Prerequisites

Node.js, Git and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Davoyandun/MENTANA-frontend.git
```

2. Install the requiered dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Add an .env file with the required environment variables (it has a help with the env.txt file of the variables used)

```bash
PORT=3001
```

## USAGE

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically start the server on port 3001 (http://localhost:3001). You can adjust the port by modifying the PORT environment variable in your .env file or directly in the code (step 3 above).
